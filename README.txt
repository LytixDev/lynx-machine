--- The 8-bit Lynx Machine ---

A simple 8-bit computer for visualizing and experimenting with computation.

TODO:
- Specification for an 8-bit abstract machine
- Implementation 0: Software - Interactive and visual web-based VM and assembler 
- Implementation 1: HDL - Verilog

Side quests:
- Simple compiler for a B-like language
- Mista zosin B integration? (https://github.com/tsoding/b)
- Synthesize HDL implementation on an FPGA?

Sketh up cpu design on paper


Chisel:
- tools:
    - switch to chiseltest?
    - generate waveform
    - verilog simulator? verilator
- actual todos:
    - instruction decode
    - complete cpu loop (decode -> execute -> update PC)

    - alu
    - register file
    - data memory

Web Impl TODOS:
- Assembler: support labels

- Assembler/ISA: more fine-grained imm operand kinds (imm_u8, imm_s8, imm_u4, imm_s4)
  Useful for checking if the imm is within bounds when assembling

- binary addition to the numberSystem? Displaying 8 zeros/ones in a small space is hard.

- amalgamate / packing script of the compiled JS files

- Add more examples
    - gcd
    - integer factorization
    - game of life ?!?!

- Add an 8-character LCD display?

- savable and url-linkable programs

- About page

- pseudo op `lfi` which can take a full 8 bit imm and will
  result in a li ms 4-bits, shift 4, and ali of the 4 ls bits

- Memory banking?

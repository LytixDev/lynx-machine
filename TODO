Web Impl TODOS:
- Assembler: support labels

- Assembler/ISA: more fine-grained imm operand kinds (imm_u8, imm_s8, imm_u4, imm_s4)
  Useful for checking if the imm is within bounds when assembling

- jiz should be pc-relative or not? Currently pc-relative.

- binary addition to the numberSystem? Displaying 8 zeros/ones in a small space is hard.

- amalgamate / packing script of the compiled JS files

- Add more examples
    - fib
    - gcd
    - prime number generator
    - integer factorization
    - game of life ?!?!

- Add an 8-character LCD display?

- savable and url-linkable programs

- simple compiler for a simple B-like langauge
  One step further: B integeration? https://github.com/tsoding/b

- BUG: assembly input field on scroll must cause a re-render

- pseudo op `lfi` which can take a full 8 bit imm and will
  result in a li ms 4-bits, shift 4, and ali of the 4 ls bits
